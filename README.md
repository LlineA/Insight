## Introduction
Medium is an online publishing platform for amateurs and professionals who want to share their ideas. With the large number of daily publications and the rigidity of the platform, writers might have a hard time reaching their audience. To maximize the number of readers, writers must optimally choose up to 5 tags to describe the content of the article. To optimize the tag selection process, I developed Tag it a web app that uses a word embedding model to recommend relevant and popular tags to medium blogpost writers.

## Data Collection
Source code for this section is available in [Tagit Development](https://github.com/LlineA/Insight/tree/master/Tagit%20Development) 

Data is collected by web scraping from medium.com. 
Two scrapers are used :
 - the first scaper gets information on articles published with specified tags. 
 - the second scraper gets the number of followers of specified tags.
 
I used Python request, BeautifulSoup, selenium, and json libraries to scrape and parse the html and json data.
